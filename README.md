# DummySwiftPackage

This is a dummy package I created while tinkering with swift package manager, so it has no meaningful content.

## How to add to your project

1) Open your Xcode project
2) Go to File > Add Package Dependencies
3) Enter the package URL in the top right corner: `https://github.com/mustafacobann/DummySwiftPackage.git`
4) Select the package that appears on the left and press Add Package

## How to use

```swift
import DummySwiftPackage

sayHello("Mustafa")
```
